The Perceptron learning algorithm is an iterative algorithm used for training binary classifiers, and it converges if the training data is linearly separable. In other words, if there exists a hyperplane that can separate the two classes of data points perfectly. Given the initial weight vector w=[1, 1], we can start applying the Perceptron learning algorithm to update the weights until convergence.

The Perceptron learning algorithm update rule is as follows:

w(t+1) = w(t) + η * (y - ŷ) * x

Where:
- w(t+1) is the updated weight vector at time t+1.
- w(t) is the current weight vector at time t.
- η (eta) is the learning rate.
- y is the true class label (+1 or -1).
- ŷ is the predicted class label (+1 or -1).
- x is the input feature vector.

Let's go through the steps of the Perceptron learning algorithm for the given data:

Initial weight vector: w = [1, 1]

Learning rate: η = 1 (for simplicity)

Data:

1. (x1=1, x2=1, Class=+1)
   Predicted class: ŷ = sign(w*x) = sign(1*1 + 1*1) = +1 (correct classification)

2. (x1=-1, x2=-1, Class=-1)
   Predicted class: ŷ = sign(1*(-1) + 1*(-1)) = -1 (correct classification)

3. (x1=0, x2=0.5, Class=-1)
   Predicted class: ŷ = sign(1*0 + 1*0.5) = +1 (misclassified, update required)
   Update w: w = [1, 1] + 1 * (-1 - 1) * [0, 0.5] = [1, 1] - [0, 0.5] = [1, 0.5]

4. (x1=0.1, x2=0.5, Class=-1)
   Predicted class: ŷ = sign(1*0.1 + 0.5*1) = +1 (misclassified, update required)
   Update w: w = [1, 0.5] + 1 * (-1 - 1) * [0.1, 0.5] = [1, 0.5] - [0.2, 1] = [0.8, -0.5]

5. (x1=0.2, x2=0.2, Class=+1)
   Predicted class: ŷ = sign(0.8*0.2 - 0.5*0.2) = +1 (correct classification)

6. (x1=0.9, x2=0.5, Class=+1)
   Predicted class: ŷ = sign(0.8*0.9 - 0.5*0.5) = +1 (correct classification)

At this point, all data points have been correctly classified, and there have been no weight updates in the last two iterations. Therefore, the Perceptron learning algorithm has converged.

The Perceptron learning algorithm converged in 4 steps.
